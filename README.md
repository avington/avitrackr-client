# AvitrackrClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Overview

This application is a task tracking application and possibly other future other mashups. That I am using to keep up to speed with latest UI frameworks.

This application uses:

- Angular 6.x
- Ngrx (switching to ngrx-data)
- Angular Kendo for some of the components
